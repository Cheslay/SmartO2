## Introduction
The purpose of this project is to make the oxygen dispensing of patients in need of oxygen easier for the healthcare personel.

## Features
- The device should be able to detect the patients oxygen saturation.

- The device decides the target saturation from the database lookup.
- The device should dispence oxygen to the patient, to reach the patients optimal saturation.
